              <h2>All About Cardio</h2>
              <h4>What is cardio training?</h4>
              <p>Cardio training is exercise with the purpose of developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_fitness" target="_blank">cardiovascular</a> or aerobic fitness. Cardiovascular fitness is a good measure of the heart’s ability to pump oxygen-rich blood to the muscles.Cardio training generally involves exercising at a constant moderate level of intensity, for a specified duration, during which the cardiovascular system is allowed to replenish oxygen to working muscles. Typical activities include walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, jump rope, stair climbing, and rowing.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
              <h4>Why is cardio training so important?</h4>
              <p>Cardio training plays a vital role in human health and performance. With regular cardio training, one can expect numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism" target="_blank">metabolic</a> changes.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
              <h4>What you should know</h4>
              <p>Just as with strength training, cardio training requires proper progression, variation, specificity, and overload if beneficial adaptations are to occur. When looking at how to design an effective cardio training program, consider the following variables:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>mode</li>
                <li>Frequency</li>
                <li>Duration</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">

            <div class="col-sm">
              <h4>1. Mode</h4>
              <p>You can alter the mode of exercise to your liking and/or ability. The following activities (among others) can be used for cardio training: swimming, rope skipping, jogging, cycling, cross country skiing, stair climbing, elliptical trainer, dancing, and rowing. When choosing your activity, consider the activities you enjoy, your skill level, your joint health and the surrounding climate.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
              <h4>2. Frequency</h4>
              <p>Frequency is the number of cardio training sessions performed per day or per week. This will be dependent on training status and intensity. 2 to 5 sessions per week will suffice. This depends on concurrent training — in other words, what other activities and/or sports you’re doing. You can attain health benefits by expending as little as 150 calories per day via cardio training. 20 minutes of cardio training, 3 times per week can maintain cardiovascular fitness levels.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
              <h4>3. Duration</h4>
              <p>Duration is the length of the cardio training session. This is directly related to the exercise intensity. Strive for 15 to 60 minutes of continuous cardio training.
